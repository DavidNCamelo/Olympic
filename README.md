# Olympic Scraping

After spending considerable time searching for a complete dataset of all historical Modern Olympic Games, the results were still limited. So, with my basic web scraping skills, I set out to retrieve as much data as possible on all events.

This repository contains the scripts developed to gather that data, with adjustments to accommodate updates made to the Olympic website for recent events. It was challenging to retrieve data for past games, while the new website structure makes it easier to access detailed information on athletes and competitions.

## CLass scripts

The files with no spaces in their titles are the class scripts used to retrieve data. These scripts are as follows:

These worked for events prior to Paris 2024:
* [Country_and_Medal_Lists](Country_and_Medals_Lists.py)
* [ExtractingMedalists](ExtractingMedalist.py)
* [Overview](Overviews.py) *(Note: This script was used to extract an overview for the Olympic Games Paris 2024, and generated null values for some important fields. For this case the values were inserted manually, searched over this page https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/the-games/olympic-paralympic-games/olympic-games)*

The following script was used to extract data starting from the Olympic Games Paris 2024. If this website structure remains the same for future events, it should be possible to use this script to scrape them as well. The main difference is that the URLs for retrieving prize lists and athlete medalists are embedded within the link structure:
* [ExtractDataSinceParis](ExtractDataSinceParis.py)

Also this last class script contains both medal tables; **Country medals and Athletes Medal**

Once the desired extraction conditions were tested, each class and function was applied across the other files in this repository. Note that ['Extract URL by Ceremony'](Extract%20URL%20by%20Ceremony.py) is only used to retrieve the main link for each event and save it in the [past_olympics.csv](past_olympics.csv) file, which stores the necessary conditions to iterate scraping for each event.

## Extract Scripts

The files with spaces in their titles are the scripts where the previously mentioned classes are applied to generate the final .csv files. Note that there is one .ipynb file, which was specifically used for extracting prize lists. Additionally, this folder includes a script designed to extract and combine results from two events where it wasnâ€™t possible to use the main Olympic page to retrieve the data.
